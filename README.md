## Note on Datasets

All datasets, apart from the Palmer Penguins dataset (penguins_size.csv, used for data visualisation in Week 6) are simulated datasets and do not contain real data. They are intended to emulate the kind of datasets students are likely to encounter in the real world and are deliberately designed to include data quality issues.
